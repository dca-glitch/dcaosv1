# Authoritative Project Control Matrix

**Document role:** Owner-approved project-control source for nomenclature and capability status before the next staging cycle.

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Workstream:** WORKSTREAM 6 — controlled staging deploy `a8a74e6` (post local pre-staging convergence)

## 1. Authority and scope

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| Repo | `C:\dcaosv1` |
| Branch | `main` |
| Repo baseline (HEAD) | `a8a74e60e05a6e9d21691bfc83bb0123899ba6f6` (`a8a74e6`) |
| Staging baseline / current artifact | `a8a74e60e05a6e9d21691bfc83bb0123899ba6f6` (`a8a74e6`) |
| Rollback target (retained) | `1b8d00db2f9d46ac6678abd576a02683ffa6d86c` (`1b8d00d`) |
| Relation | `a8a74e6` is the controlled staging deploy of local pre-staging convergence; schema delta `1b8d00d..a8a74e6`: none |
| Staging `a8a74e6` | PASS (health + required smokes) |
| Validate at baseline | PASS |
| Production | FROZEN |
| Remote freshness | `origin/main` = `a8a74e6` (pre-docs-closeout deploy HEAD; docs closeout commit follows) |

This document controls **nomenclature** and **status labels** for planning and execution before the next staging cycle. It does **not** replace technical runbooks (`STAGING_READINESS`, `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT`, `PRODUCTION_ROLLBACK`, integration proof runbooks, or operator checklists).

## 2. Numbering systems

Three implementation/planning systems plus historical G-gates. **Do not mix or substitute them.**

| System | Function | Scope | Source | Mixing rule |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **BLOKI 1–13** | Functional implementation roadmap | Feature/auth/portal/briefs/notifications/WordPress/E2E delivery blocks | Owner-approved BLOK table (this matrix §3) | Never rename Workstreams or UI Fazy as BLOKI |
| **Fazy UI 1–13** | UI redesign roadmap | Dark Nebula / dense admin / design-system presentation work | UI direction docs (`docs/ui/*`, Dark Nebula product UI direction) | Never treat UI Fazy as functional BLOKI or snapshot Workstreams |
| **Workstreamy 1–9** | Pre-next-staging execution plan | Local hardening → staging live proofs → planning go/no-go | Owner-approved Workstream table (this matrix §4) | Never claim a Workstream “completes” a BLOK by number alone |
| **G-gates** | Historical gate ledger | Past pre-live / foundation / proof planning sequence (G49–G708+) | `docs/STATUS.md`, deferred-scope register, gate runbooks | Historical context only unless an owner gate re-activates a specific G-id |

---

## 3. Implementation BLOKI 1–13

| BLOK | Content | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Auth: ChangePasswordModal, CreateUserModal, ResetPasswordModal | COMPLETE |
| 2 | Puriva Client Portal: ArticleApprovalEditor, pending approvals, Resend notification foundation | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Fix 403: owner role for `admin@dca.local`, owner bypass in pending approvals | COMPLETE |
| 4 | createUser + clientId, ClientUserAccess in transaction, TeamView client selector | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Role-based UI, filterNavigationByRole, redirect client to `#/client-portal` | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Comprehensive test suite | COMPLETE |
| 7 | Content editing metadata, audit trail, ClientEdit; BLOK 7-UI design system foundation | COMPLETE |
| 8 | Brief model/API/UI, archive, monthly reports, client dashboard, brief-submitted notification foundation | COMPLETE |
| 9 | Google Docs UI frontend | DEFERRED — owner decision 2026-07-11 |
| 10 | Email notifications activation | ABSORBED INTO SNAPSHOT WORKSTREAMS |
| 11 | WordPress publish E2E verification | ABSORBED INTO SNAPSHOT WORKSTREAMS |
| 12 | Staging deployment | ABSORBED INTO SNAPSHOT WORKSTREAMS |
| 13 | Full Puriva E2E | ABSORBED INTO SNAPSHOT WORKSTREAMS |

**Note:** BLOKI 10–13 are **absorbed**, not cancelled.

---

## 4. Workstreams 1–9

| Workstream | Location | Scope |
|------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Local | Authoritative status matrix, security/dependency triage, component-system decision, rollback/compatibility plan |
| 2 | Local | Notification contracts, storage contracts, AI provider contracts, OAuth, WordPress contracts |
| 3 | Local | AI Delivery decomposition, shared UI states, design-system consolidation, code splitting |
| 4 | Local | Orchestrator Lite hardening, bounded MI v2, image workflow, reports, WordPress workflow |
| 5 | Local | Full validate, unit/integration tests, browser smokes, security regression, local UI/UX audit |
| 6 | VPS staging | Artifact upload, DB backup, migrations, API/web deploy, core health smoke |
| 7 | VPS staging | Live proofs: Email → AI → R2 → Image → WordPress → GA/GSC → MI |
| 8 | VPS staging | Puriva E2E, failure paths, runtime UI/UX audit, security audit, rollback rehearsal |
| 9 | Planning | Credential rotation, migration plan, explicit owner go/no-go |

**Active closeout:** Workstreams 1–5 local + Workstream 6 controlled staging deploy `a8a74e6` COMPLETE; staging API runtime advanced through `c07df10` (OpenAI Images) to artifact `bd649d5` for WordPress dedicated one-draft proof (prior R2 cleanup support on `4cd6d58`). Workstream 7 Email = **STAGING PROVIDER ACCEPTANCE PROVEN**. AI-A Orchestrator = **CONFIG SHAPE PROVEN**. AI-B AI Delivery / OpenRouter path = **STAGING LIVE PROVEN**. R2 private storage exact object roundtrip = **STAGING LIVE PROVEN**. OpenAI Images staging one-image AI Policy path = **STAGING LIVE PROVEN**. WordPress dedicated staging one-draft path = **STAGING LIVE PROVEN** (bounded create-and-trash only). Next: GA/GSC → MI. Production remains FROZEN.

## 5. Capability status standard

Owner-approved five-level labels. Do **not** invent a competing status system.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| NOT IMPLEMENTED | No code |
| LOCAL FOUNDATION | Code or workflow exists locally; no live proof |
| CONFIG SHAPE PROVEN | Configuration or contract confirmed without live IO |
| STAGING PROVIDER ACCEPTANCE PROVEN | Staging provider accepted the request (e.g. Resend HTTP OK + message id + EmailLog); not inbox/webhook delivery |
| STAGING LIVE PROVEN | Real proof on staging including delivery/receipt where the capability requires it |
| PRODUCTION LIVE PROVEN | Real proof on production |

Applied migration or local unit/integration proof alone does **not** justify `STAGING LIVE PROVEN` or `PRODUCTION LIVE PROVEN`.

## 7. Current dependency findings

**Source:** Vite remediation closeout (commit `95af080`) + Workstream 1 Point 1 confirmation at `250e958` (2026-07-12).
**Fix status:** Vite high finding **CLOSED** locally. No `npm audit fix` / `--force` was used.

### Audit summary (post-remediation)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 0 (Vite high finding remediated via Vite `6.4.3`) |
| Moderate | Remaining transitive findings may still exist (`esbuild`, `gaxios`, `googleapis`, `googleapis-common`, `uuid`) — not claimed closed here |
| Low / info | not claimed here |

### Vite remediation (Point 1 — COMPLETE)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Package | `vite` (direct dependency of `@dca-os-v1/web`) |
| Repo build version | Vite `6.4.3` |
| Remediation commit | `95af080` |
| Prior high advisory set | Included `GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff` for `vite` `<=6.4.2` |
| Classification | **COMPLETE** — high finding closed locally; full validate PASS at remediation |
| Not claimed | Production exploit history rewritten; all moderate findings closed; staging redeploy of Vite change |

**Rules:** Do not run `npm audit fix` / `--force`. Do not claim moderate findings remediated until separately triaged. Do not treat Vite remediation as a staging deploy authorization.

## 8. Open decisions

| Decision | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Canonical component system (`components/ui` public + `design-system` private) | **COMPLETE** (WS1 Point 2) — Waves 1–5 migration still open |
| Wave 0 component import guard | **COMPLETE** (`250e958`; 108 frozen baseline violations) |
| Orchestrator proof position in mandatory live-proof sequence | **COMPLETE decision** — `HYBRID — PREFLIGHT + EMBEDDED LIVE PROOF`. **AI-A staging preflight KEEP (2026-07-12):** Orchestrator = `CONFIG SHAPE PROVEN`. **Cannot** reach `STAGING LIVE PROVEN` until plan→execute is wired. **AI-B KEEP (2026-07-12):** AI Delivery OpenRouter path = `STAGING LIVE PROVEN` (not Orchestrator live). **R2 KEEP (2026-07-12):** private-storage exact object roundtrip = `STAGING LIVE PROVEN`. **OpenAI Images KEEP (2026-07-12):** staging one-image AI Policy path = `STAGING LIVE PROVEN` (one bounded neutral image only). **WordPress KEEP (2026-07-12):** dedicated staging one-draft create-and-trash = `STAGING LIVE PROVEN` on `bd649d5`. Next live integration gate = GA/GSC. |
| Rollback / compatibility plan | **COMPLETE** — verdict `ROLLBACK READY WITH CONDITIONS`; known-good target `1b8d00d` |
| Rollback rehearsal | **OPEN** — separately gated; **not executed** |
| SHA-tagged retained staging API image (`staging-dcaosv1-staging-api:1b8d00d`) | **OPEN** until staging safeguard phase |
| Image provider selection | **COMPLETE (2026-07-12 pivot + staging one-image KEEP)** — active primary=`openai`, model=`gpt-image-1`, adapter=`OpenAIImageAdapter`; BFL/`flux-2-pro` preserved inactive; staging one-image live proven on `c07df10`; broader image workflows still OPEN |
| AI Policy / provider routing architecture alignment | **COMPLETE** (docs-only 2026-07-12) — prohibits parallel modality routing systems; does not implement adapters |
| Production artifact SHA and rollback target | UNKNOWN / OPEN (production FROZEN; staging target remains `1b8d00d`) |
| Staging credential availability for next live proofs | OPEN |
| Production Turnstile and R2 credential rotation execution | OPEN — DEFERRED (Phase B/C) |

---

## 9. Current execution boundary

| Boundary | State |
|----------|--------|
| Workstream 1 Points 1–4 | **COMPLETE** at repo HEAD `250e958` |
| Active next local Workstreams | **2–5** (integration contracts → architecture/UI → workflow hardening → full local validation) |
| Commit / push / deploy | **No approval** unless owner grants separately |
| Staging mutation | **No deploy** — last proven artifact remains `1b8d00d`; safeguard backups/tags only when separately authorized |
| Production mutation | **No** — production FROZEN |
| Next staging artifact | **Does not exist yet** |
| Live provider calls in local Workstreams 2–5 | **No** (except explicitly gated live proofs later) |
| Orchestrator plan→execute live wiring | **Not authorized** by WS1 closeout |

## 10. Workstream 1 point ledger

| Point | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 — Vite security remediation | **COMPLETE** | Vite `6.4.3`; high finding closed; validate PASS; commit `95af080` |
| 2 — Canonical component system decision | **COMPLETE** | Public: `apps/web/src/components/ui`; private: `apps/web/src/design-system` |
| Wave 0 — import guard | **COMPLETE** | Commit `250e958`; baseline freezes 108 existing violations; new violations = 0 |
| 3 — Rollback / compatibility plan | **COMPLETE** (rehearsal separately gated) | Verdict `ROLLBACK READY WITH CONDITIONS`; target `1b8d00d`; schema delta none |
| 4 — Orchestrator proof decision | **COMPLETE** | `HYBRID — PREFLIGHT + EMBEDDED LIVE PROOF`; Orchestrator stays `LOCAL FOUNDATION` |

**Not marked complete:** rollback rehearsal; SHA-tagged retained API image (pre-safeguard); Waves 1–5 UI migration; Orchestrator `STAGING LIVE PROVEN`.
